The package `identifiers` provides classes that can be used to create and
check identifiers for unique objects or unique classes of objects
according to international standards.

*Definition from Wikipedia*:

"An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of)
either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the "object" or
class may be an idea, physical [countable] object (or class thereof), or
physical [noncountable] substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID
often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an
identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a
word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those."
